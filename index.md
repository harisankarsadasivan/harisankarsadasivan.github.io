## About Me

Dr. Harisankar (Hari) Sadasivan is a Staff Engineer in the AMD AI Group and a faculty member (part-time) at the University of Washington, Seattle. At AMD, Hari co-leads several research projects on optimizing irregular AI and genomics kernels on modern multi-chiplet GPUs. At UW, Hari designed and teaches a parallel programming course on GPUs. Hari received his PhD and Masters in CSE from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor where he was advised by [Prof. Satish Narayanasamy](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/people/narayanasamy-satish/). Hari's PhD research focussed on HW-SW co-design for accelerated and portable long-read DNA sequencing. Hari's PhD research has won the 2022 MICRO Top Picks with Honorable Mention (with several artifact badges). Hari is a Technical reviewer with several IEEE/ACM venues including CAL, TACO, CGO, MICRO, IPDPS-RAW, IISWC and an editorial board member on several AI and genomics journals. Hari has previously worked with NVIDIA and Samsung R&D.
